Specify tags by which both classes and class members (i.e. fields, constructors and methods) are completely excluded from the generated documentation.
<p>
A <b>class</b> is excluded when at least one of the conditions is met:
<ol>
<li>The class has one of the specified tags.</li>
<li>This is an inner class and one of its enclosing classes has one of the specified tags.</li>
</ol>
A class <b>member</b> is excluded according to one of the conditions:
<ol>
<li>The member has one of the specified tags.</li>
<li>The member's class has one of the specified tags.</li>
<li>The member's class is an inner class and one of its enclosing classes has one of the specified tags.</li>
</ol>

Therefore, when a class has one of the tags specified in this parameter, neither that class nor anything defined in it (i.e. members and inner classes) will ever appear in the documentation.
<p>
The multiple exclude-tag names must be separated with new lines ('\n'), semicolons (';') or colons (':').
For example:
<blockquote><pre><code>
@exclude
@omit
</code></pre></blockquote>
