<b>Note:</b> DocFlex/Doclet does not (and is not required to) support directly
all extra options provided by the 
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/javadoc/standard-doclet.html">Standard Doclet</a>.
However, for compatibility with some other software (e.g. <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Apache Maven</a>),
many of such options can be effectively supported by mapping them to 
the default values of corresponding template parameters.
